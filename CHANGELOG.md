  - <h3>__Deprecations__</h3>
    - Deprecating [waitForActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActiveOrDelete--) and [waitForAllActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForAllActiveOrDelete--) methods in Table class which can give incorrect results if they are called immediatedly after creating or deleting a table. This is due to dynamoDb operations being eventually consistent and might take a few seconds to propagate the new status. Use [waitForActive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActive--) and [waitForDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForDelete--) instead.
