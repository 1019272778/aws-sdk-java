/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonECS.
 *
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
 * container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and
 * manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS
 * lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple
 * API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a
 * centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2
 * features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
 * your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and
 * availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the
 * need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration
 * management systems or worry about scaling your management
 * infrastructure.
 * </p>
